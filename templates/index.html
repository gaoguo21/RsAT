</h1>
    <p class="hero-desc">
      This free RNA-seq analysis platform provides simple, beginner friendly tools for common analyses without coding or complex software installation. I also provide executable pipeline files in the Sources tab for converting FASTQ files to gene counts. They are designed and optimized to run locally on a personal computer. </p>

      <h3>DEG - Differential Gene Expression Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed between experimental conditions.
        This tool compares expression levels, calculates fold changes, p-values and adjusted pValues.

      <h3>Pathway Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Analyze biological pathways enriched in your gene list to understand functional meaning.
        This tool links differential expression results to pathways, processes, and molecular functions for interpretation.

      <h3>ID2Symbol - Mapping gene ID to symbol</h3>
      <p>
        A tool that maps Ensembl Gene IDs (ENSG) and Entrez Gene IDs to official gene symbols.
        It enables standardized gene annotation and conversion between identifier systems.

      <h3>ssGSEA-single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</h3>
      <p>
  A tool that calculate an enrichment score for a predefined gene set. 
It ranks all genes in a sample by expression and derives a score reflecting the relative enrichment of the predefined gene set.
